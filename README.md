一个被魔改的QQ，里面自带一个源代码和一个安装器。

此应用的代码原本是易语言的，但是被我移植到Python了，C++暂无实现。

里面有成品的安装程序(易语言编写)，还有一个利用Python编写的安装程序(从DesTemp QQ 4.0.0开始携带)，Launcher也是和安装程序一样的道理。

另外，我希望有人可以为这个项目来做出一些贡献，哪怕是一个文件修改了一个字符也可以。

A QQ that has been changed by magic, which comes with a source code and an installer.

The code of this application was originally easy to language, but I ported it to Python, and C++ has not been implemented yet.

There is a ready-made installer (written in easy language), and an installer written in Python (carried from DesTemp QQ 4.0.0), and the Launcher is the same as the installer.

Also, I'd like someone to contribute to the project, even if it's a file that modifies a single character.
